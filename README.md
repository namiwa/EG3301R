## ASI-304: Applying AI and Machine Learning to Satellite Data

This repo documents our technical exploration of applying AI and ML techniques on satellite data. See our prototype model running on Tensorflow.js [here.](https://asi-304-prototype.netlify.app/#/)

### Installation

- Clone this repo into a local directory
- Install Anaconda/Miniconda depending on your preference
- Create a Python virtual environment, minimally with Python version 3.6
- Activate the conda virtual environment, and install the following dependancies via pip install :
  ```
  pip install numpy pandas seaborn tensorflow-gpu opencv-python jupyter notebook
  ```
- Download the [Eurosat Dataset](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) and unzip the EuroSat folder into the root directory of the local repo
- Attempt to run the jupyter notebooks to observe if the install had been successful

### Flask Backend Server

#### Core Server Dependacies

- Flask
- Flask-Restful
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Python-OpenCV
- Sci-Kit Learn version 0.22.2-1post to match Gooogle Collab version
- Dotenv
- Google Earth Engine Python Backend
  - [View installation steps for python backend](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install)

#### Managing Conda environment

The root environment files contain the needed packages to run some of the jupyter notebooks found here. **Note that the version of python needed is 3.7.**

### Tensorflow Environment

No other configuration needed

### Solaris Environment

Clone the [Solaris](https://github.com/CosmiQ/solaris) repository locally. Set up the solaris conda environment using the yml file above, and change directory to the cloned repository. Run `pip install .` within the solaris repository to add solaris to the virtual environment.
